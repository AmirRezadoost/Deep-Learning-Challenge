The objective of the competition is to train a deep learning model to perform image classification on a dataset with eight classes. The main difficulty of the competition lies in the presence of a domain shift between training and test data, as you can see by inspecting the dataset.
two approaches were used for this problem: 1. using FastR_CNN  2. ResNet50
